# Week1-Homework-Wymore
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as your source.

Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages for more guidance.

Important: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
